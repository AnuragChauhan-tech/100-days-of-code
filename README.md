# 100-days-of-code
coding in  the first year of btech can be much much boring when you dont have any kind of coding experience but with  good  guidance and support its very easy , i  started coding i few weeks back and couldn't learn much cause of inconsistancy but now i am here to start the challenge , 100 days of code.
